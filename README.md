# Family AI chess tournament
Christmas 2016 I am competing with my brothers
and to see who can produce the best chess AI. 
Mum will play the AIs we write to see if she can beat them.

# Rules
The AI will work by reading in a file called “game state.txt”
looking at the last game state then appending a new game state to the file.
The programs of the players will be run alternately.

A player loses if:
- They make an illegal move
- Their time remaining hits 0
- Their king is taken

Human players have no time limit on their moves as long as they are actively working on the game.
